Game Module: Minesweeper

1. Module Overview
Minesweeper is a classic logic-based puzzle game integrated into the GameHub platform.
The main purpose of this module is to challenge the player’s logical reasoning, pattern recognition,
and decision-making skills. Within GameHub, Minesweeper serves as a strategic and cognitive mini-game,
offering a slower-paced but intellectually engaging contrast to action-oriented games.

2. Functional Requirements

Game Modes:
- Single Player Mode
- Difficulty Levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced (defined by grid size and number of mines)

Game Rules:
- The game board consists of a grid with hidden mines.
- The player reveals cells by clicking on them.
- Revealing a mine ends the game.
- Revealing a safe cell displays the number of adjacent mines.
- Cells with zero adjacent mines automatically reveal neighboring cells.
- The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.

Constraints:
- Mines are placed randomly at the start of each game.
- The first revealed cell is guaranteed not to be a mine.
- The player cannot reveal already opened or flagged cells.
- The game ends immediately upon clicking a mine.

3. Technical Implementation

Data Structures:
- 2D Array / Grid to represent the game board.
- Cell object attributes: isMine, isRevealed, isFlagged, adjacentMineCount.

Algorithms:
- Mine placement algorithm excluding the first-click cell.
- Adjacency calculation algorithm.
- Flood fill algorithm (DFS/BFS) for empty cell expansion.
- Win condition checking algorithm.

Unity Components:
- GameObject, MonoBehaviour, Button, Canvas
- Text/TMP_Text for UI elements
- SceneManager for scene transitions

4. User Interface (UI) Design

Visual Layout:
- Main Menu: Start Game, Difficulty Selection, Exit to GameHub
- Game Screen: Grid board, mine counter, timer
- End Game Screen: Win/Lose message, final time, restart option
